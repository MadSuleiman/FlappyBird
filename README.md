# FlappyBird
CSE 165 Final Project

Compiling

Both Mac and Windows should compile successfully when the make file is used, but they are serious linking errors that may cause any of these to fail. 

Ensure that you have the corret directories set up, and make sure you have opengl available on your device. If compiling on Mac, ensure you are using a M1 device with an arm processor. 

This has not been tested on Intel based Macs.
 
Windows

CD into the main folder of the project and run make. The make file should detect your operating system and compile accordingly. After compiling, run ./flappybird.exe in your terminal

Game

The design of this game is simple, get through the pipes, touch one, die. 

The speed is highly volatile and depends on the system running it, where my laptop runs at a face pace while some may run slow. Speeds can be altered to match the speed of machine. We hope to automate this soon.
