# FlappyBird
CSE 165 Final Project

Compiling

Both Mac and Windows should compile successfully when the make file is used, but they are serious linking errors that may cause any of these to fail. 

Ensure that you have the corret directories set up, and make sure you have opengl available on your device. If compiling on Mac, ensure you are using a M1 device with an arm processor. 

This has not been tested on Intel based Macs.
